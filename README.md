#CodenameOne JS

##Synopsis

The Codename One JS Bridge package includes classes that facilitate the interaction between Java and Javascript in a Codename One application. It allows both Java to Javascript communication and the reverse via a mechanism similar to the one employed by Phone Gap/Apache Cordova.
