#CodenameOne JS

A Java/Javascript bridge for Codename One

Note:  This library has now been amalgamated into the Codename One core as the package com.codename1.javascript.  You are encouraged to use that package now instead of this library.

##Synopsis

The Codename One JS Bridge package includes classes that facilitate the interaction between Java and Javascript in a Codename One application. It allows both Java to Javascript communication and the reverse via a mechanism similar to the one employed by Phone Gap/Apache Cordova.
